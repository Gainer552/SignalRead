signal_read.sh - Telemetry Visibility Tool

Overview
signal_read.sh is a lightweight Bash script that inspects Ubuntu and Arch Linux
systems for telemetry-related services, packages, and configuration settings.
It highlights whether telemetry components are installed, enabled, or active,
and presents the results in a color-coded, human-readable format.

The purpose of this tool is to help system administrators, security enthusiasts,
and privacy-conscious users quickly identify background processes and services
that may be collecting or transmitting usage data.

Features
- Detects known telemetry components on Ubuntu (ubuntu-report, popularity-contest,
  apport, whoopsie, motd-news, livepatch tooling).
- Detects known telemetry components on Arch Linux (pkgstats and timer).
- Scans systemd unit files for telemetry/metrics/report-related services and timers.
- Displays results in clear, color-coded sections with headers.
- Works in read-only mode â€” no services are enabled, disabled, or modified.

Usage
1. Make the script executable: chmod +x signal_read.sh
2. Run the script: ./signal_read.sh
3. Review the results to see which telemetry-related components are present
   and their current states.
